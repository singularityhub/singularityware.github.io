Singularity 2.4 is released, and here are the important notes for you to know about!

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/posts/releases/singularity-egg-easy.png">


**Singularity Build**
Building an image is now more intuitive with the introduction of our `build` command. You don't need to worry about using `create`, or `bootstrap`, you just build. It looks like this:

```
sudo singularity build container.simg Singularity
```

If you are tired of needing to estimate your image size, that issue goes away with build. The default format for a Singularity image base is now a smaller, compressed file format called **SquashFS**.  This format is also a much better fit for reproducible containers, as it is immutable. For more details, see our [build](/docs-build-container) documentation.

**Build Bases**
We originally supported just using an existing distribution package or docker as a base for building images. With 2.4, we have extended that set to include another Singularity image (`localimage`), or a Singularity Hub or Registry image (`shub`).

**Instance Support**
Singularity now has support for instances, which means services! Images instances can be started, stopped, and listed. Along with instances comes **Network Namespace Isolation**. We are excited to see the kinds of use cases that this will afford for our users. 

**Singularity Registry**
If you want to host your own Registry, we listened and you are in luck! Singularity <a href="https://www.github.com/singularityhub/sregistry">Registry</a> is ready for your use, along with a <a href="https://singularityhub.github.io/containers">portal</a> for you to "register your registry" to make it easier to share your images. Singularity Hub, along with improved building and updated builders, will follow this release.

**Internal Modularity**
This release includes support for the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/docs-apps">Standard Container Integration Format (SCI-F)</a> that makes it easy for you to produce single, internally modular and programmatically discoverable containers. More information is provided on it's <a href="https://containers-ftw.github.io/SCI-F/">main site</a>.

**Better Documentation**
We've added an entire page on the different customizations you can do to the [build environment](/build-environment), including changing the cache and specifying credentials for Docker. We now also have new sidebars for the Image and Instances command groups.


**Deprecated**
We are deprecating the original `create` command to be replaced with `image.create`, along with `bootstrap` in favor with build. These commands will still work for 2.4, however we recommend you start testing the updated ones.

In addition, here are some tiny changes for your information!

- Persistent Overlay
- Container checks
- Tests for instance support
- Wrapper for create
- Group instance commands
- Group image commands
- Bash completion updates
