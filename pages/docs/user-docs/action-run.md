It's common to want your container to "do a thing." Singularity `run` allows you to define a custom action to be taken when a container is either `run` or executed directly by file name. Specifically, you might want it to execute a command, or run an executable that gives access to many different functions for the user.

## Overview
First, how do we run a container? We can do that in one of two ways - the commands below are identical:

```bash
$ singularity run centos7.img
$ ./centos7.img
```

In both cases, we are executing the container's "runscript"  (the executable `/singularity` at the root of the image) that is either an actual file (version 2.2 and earlier) or a link to one (2.3 and later). For example, looking at a 2.3 image, I can see the runscript via the path to the link:

```
$ singularity exec centos7.img cat /singularity
#!/bin/sh

exec /bin/bash "$@"
```

or to the actual file in the container's metadata folder, `/.singularity.d`

```
$ singularity exec centos7.img cat /.singularity.d/runscript
#!/bin/sh

exec /bin/bash "$@"
```

Notice how the runscript has bash followed by `$@`? This is good practice to include in a runscript, as any arguments passed by the user will be given to the container.

## Runtime Flags
If you are interested in containing an environment or filesystem locations, we highly recommend that you look at the `singularity run help` and our documentation on [flags]({{ site.baseurl }}/action-flags) to better customize this command.

## Examples
In this example the container has a very simple runscript defined.
```
$ singularity exec centos7.img cat /singularity
#!/bin/sh

echo motorbot

$ singularity run centos7.img
motorbot
```

### Defining the Runscript
When you first create a container, the runscript is defined using the following order of operations:

 1. A user defined runscript in the `%runscript` section of a bootstrap takes preference over all
 2. If the user has not defined a runscript and is importing a Docker container, the Docker `ENTRYPOINT` is used.
 3. If a user has not defined a runscript and adds `IncludeCmd: yes` to the bootstrap file, the `CMD` is used over the `ENTRYPOINT`
 4. If the user has not defined a runscript and the Docker container doesn't have an `ENTRYPOINT`, we look for `CMD`, even if the user hasn't asked for it.
 5. If the user has not defined a runscript, and there is no `ENTRYPOINT` or `CMD` (or we aren't importing Docker at all) then we default to `/bin/bash`

Here is how you would define the runscript section when you [build]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs-build-container) an image:

```bash
Bootstrap: docker
From: ubuntu:latest

%runscript
exec /usr/bin/python "$@"
```

and of course python should be installed as /usr/bin/python. The addition of `"$@"` ensures that arguments are passed along from the user. If you want your container to run absolutely any command given to it, and you want to use run instead of exec, you could also just do:

```bash
Bootstrap: docker
From: ubuntu:latest

%runscript
exec "$@"`
```

If you want different entrypoints for your image, we recommend using the `%apprun` syntax (see [apps]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs-apps)). Here we have two entrypoints for foo and bar:

```
%runscript
exec echo "Try running with --app dog/cat"

%apprun dog
exec echo Hello "$@", this is Dog

%apprun cat
exec echo Meow "$@", this is Cat
```

and then running (after build of a complete recipe) would look like:

```
sudo singularity build catdog.simg Singularity 

$ singularity run catdog.simg 
Try running with --app dog/cat

$ singularity run --app cat catdog.simg
 Meow , this is Cat
$ singularity run --app dog catdog.simg  
Hello , this is Dog
```

Generally, it is advised to provide help for your container with `%help` or `%apphelp`. If you find it easier, you can also provide help by way of a runscript that tells your user how to use the container, and gives access to the important executables. Regardless of your strategy. a reproducible container is one that tells the user how to interact with it.
